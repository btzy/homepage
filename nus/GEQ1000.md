Taken in AY18/19 Sem 1.

This is a compulsory module for all students (regardless of faculty), and all lectures are online.  Face-to-face tutorials are conducted fortnightly.

The module gives a taste of the kind of reasoning and questioning in different disciplines.  When I took it, six disciplines were explored â€” computational thinking, design, economics, engineering, philosophy, and physics.  For each discipline, there is a series of online lectures, an online quiz, and a tutorial session.

Workload is relatively light.  Furthermore, as this module is graded on a CS/CU basis, it is rather relaxed and there is little pressure to complete every single assignment (this may be helpful during busy periods of the semester).

There are no group projects, midterms or finals for this module.
