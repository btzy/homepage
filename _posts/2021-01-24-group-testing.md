title: Group Testing to Save The World (A Layman Introduction to Group Testing)
layout: blog
---

Over the December vacation, I introduced [Lieu Zheng Hong](https://lieuzhenghong.com/) to group testing (which is the topic of my integrated honours thesis), and collaborated with him to write an introductory blog post about it, entitled [Group Testing to Save The World](https://lieuzhenghong.com/group_testing/).  It is meant to be accessible to the non-technical reader.

This is the first time I'm writing (or even collaborating on) such a piece, and the whole process was quite novel to me.  Click the link in the previous paragraph to read it.
